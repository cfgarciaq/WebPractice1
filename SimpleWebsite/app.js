/*
    From Microsoft:
    JavaScript was designed to be easy to learn 
    and allows certain mistakes to be made by the developer. 
    For example, JavaScript doesn't throw an error 
    when you use a misspelled variable, and instead creates 
    a new global one. When you start learning JavaScript, 
    having fewer errors is convenient. However, it can lead 
    to writing code that is harder for browsers to optimize 
    and harder for you to debug.
